# Pnemonia-diagnosis

Contains Research Project files for Horizon Academic Summer Program of 2021. This project has code resources for a Machine Learning Model to diagnose pneumonia. Summary of the research is available in https://jsr.org/preprints/harp/preprint/view/63/71

The model was generated after training from the NIH Chest X-Ray dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. Chest_Xray.py reads the images from the dataset and builds the model using Keras and Tensorflow. The process I used is repeatable by running Chest_Xray.py after copying Chest_XRay.py to chest_xray folder along with all the X-Ray dataset images (also works with custom dataset included in the same folder).
